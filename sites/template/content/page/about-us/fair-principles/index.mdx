The Riverscapes Consortium (RC) believes that riverscapes can be improved and become more resilient to threats like increasing severity of floods, droughts, fires, exotic invasions, pollution and land use changes. However, it requires thinking more strategically and working smarter with limited resources. One of the central ways we do that is through [F-A-I-R data principles](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/).  


By following F-A-I-R principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), we can:
- lower barriers to effective collaboration 
- leverage past work and be able to access and share any tool, model output or analysis
- communicate our science easily and effectively
- make riverscapes-specific data more explorable and useful
- make it easier to produce, curate and organize riverscapes 
- simplify the ability for tool users to make tool outputs F-A-I-R 


## RC Standards and Compliance 
We have developed specific model and data standards to help the riverscapes community follow F-A-I-R principles. Packaging data as riverscapes projects allows the tool developer and user to access, explore, and use riverscape data to reach broader audiences. 
 
We encourage and support transparency, reproducibility and sharing of riverscapes data and analyses through the RC standards of practice. By investing in standards and compliance, the riverscapes community can more easily access the tools, data, and people to help improve riverscape health and contribute to a more resilient future.
