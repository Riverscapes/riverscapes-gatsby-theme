## Workshops and Events 

The Riverscapes Consortium brings together diverse perspectives and approaches to increase awareness about riverscapes and offer training in riverscape health management and restoration. We offer online and in-person workshops and events on various riverscape topics, depending on the context, throughout the year. We also feature learning opportunities from members and partners so that we can elevate and support efforts to increase awareness and education about riverscape health worldwide.
 
As a collective of people who want to improve riverscape health, we hope to continually create opportunities for innovation by staying current with what is happening in our riverscapes community. We encourage anyone delivering riverscapes education or event to get in touch with us so that we can share with our consortium community and beyond.
