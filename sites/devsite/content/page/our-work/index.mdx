The Riverscapes Consortium (RC) helps people who care about riverscape health to make a difference in their communities and contribute to a broader global conversation with concerned people ready to take action. The effects of riverscape degradation are far-reaching and extreme events such as flooding, fires, and droughts threaten the fresh water supply for all living species. 

Through our platforms, we encourage an exchange of knowledge, support, and sharing between anyone with a stake and interest in their riverscapes. Together, we can tackle the crisis of riverscape health with the urgency it deserves. 


## Benefits of working with the RC

One of our primary goals is to make it easier to catalogue, discover, and share observations of riverscapes so we can improve the future of riverscape health. 

We lower the barriers to creating, contributing, and sharing the products of riverscapes analysis, monitoring and modeling. The benefit to members is that they can more easily track responses to floods, fires and droughts while sharing ongoing restoration and conservation efforts. 

We have adopted and developed data standards for organizing and visualizing common river datasets. We have also created tools that automate the collection of disparate public data to make it easier for researchers, restoration practitioners, scientists, and students to study and manage riverscapes.

By developing the RC Exchange and Riverscape Compliant Models, we’re working towards solving the pressing challenge of riverscape degradation through open source and FAIR tools that foster awareness, action, and impact in communities worldwide.
