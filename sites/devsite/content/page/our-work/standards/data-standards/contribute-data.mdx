The Riverscapes Exchange is an open portal where anyone can share data related to riverscapes health. 
Your data must be in open data formats and you need to accompany each upload with a simple, minimal XML file that describes the data. (link to data standards page).

We are actively developing end user tools with which you can upload data into the Riverscapes Exchange yourself. However, in the interim, please reachout to the riverscapes team (TODO: create email address data@riverscapes.net) to arrange incorporation of your data into the exchange. 

Once your data are in the Exchange they will appear in search results and Web Map Viewer. Users will also be able to download the data and view it in desktop GIS. They can use it to make maps themselves or use our QGIS and ArcGIS plugins to get carefully curated cartography.

## What Type of Data?
Anything related to riverscapes health.
Geospatial data are the logical choice because we have mapping tools that automate the cartography for you. But it could simply be flat files, collections of images etc.
No (practical) file size limitations.
See the data standards (link) for more information
