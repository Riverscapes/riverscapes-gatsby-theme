Populate with potentially multiple pages on tool standards and documentation standards. Most content will move over to https://developers.riverscapes.net


Aidaâ€™s notes:

This page needs to be an introduction to this information https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/ and link to the new developers.riverscapes.net site which will host the fulsome information contained on this page

aida.viziru@gmail.com I think that this content can go away. Or at the very least it can be linked from Data Standards and Tool Standards page.

The original content was just Joe trying to provide some examples of how to document riverscapes tools as guidance for folks in his lab. I think that the Data Standards page will cover this content.
