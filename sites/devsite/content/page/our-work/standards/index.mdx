> Riverscape Consortium Standards support the riverscapes community by offering rigorous, transparent, technical specifications for data and tools development. We encourage restoration practitioners and tool developers to learn about our standards, assess tools and data for use in their projects, and take the next step in pursuing RC-Compliance.

      ## Model standards

      Guided by the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse (FAIR), we have developed the RC model standards to make it easier for the riverscapes community to understand the capabilities of a tool, what inputs it requires and what outputs it produces. Learn more about RC tool standards (link).

      ## Data standards

      We have developed a data standard for packaging and distributing riverscapes analyses (inputs and outputs of any RC compliant tool) into riverscapes projects. Packaging data as riverscapes projects helps both the tool developer and user to access, explore, and use riverscape data and reach broader audiences.

        ## Standards of practice

        Our philosophy is that consistent documentation and clear, transparent and rigorous standards help us be more effective in improving riverscape health. Standards help us focus on the work of improving riverscape health and less time performing routine data management such as organizing, naming and symbolizing data. By fostering transparency, reproducibility and sharing of riverscapes data and analyses, we facilitate the riverscapes community to follow and invest in the RC standards of practice.
