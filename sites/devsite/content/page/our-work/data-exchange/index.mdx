The RC Data Exchange is a free portal where riverscape practitioners can exchange data related to riverscapes. Our goal is to make it easier to catalogue, discover, share and retrieve data related to riverscapes health.
 
## Benefits of the RC Data Exchange
Improving riverscape health takes a collective of people committed to creating thriving, healthy ecosystems.  We want to support anyone engaged in this work by facilitating discovery and sharing through our RC Data Exchange. 
 
### Why participate in the exchange? 

- The RC Data Exchange provides free access to both the underlying data as well as making these data discoverable via a warehouse explorer and interactive web maps
- Develop your own custom data collections in the RC Data Exchange with control over user permissions and public facing metadata.
By hosting your own data in the RC Data Exchange you can make outputs of riverscapes analysis and research accessible to decision makers and practitioners to inform riverscape management.
- Catalogue and index data so it is easily discoverable
- Benefit from consistent, relevant cartography to aid and speed comprehension by always looking at the same data the same way without the laborious task of building custom maps.
- Reach a broader audience and have more impact with your work.
- Join a growing worldwide community who is working to improve riverscape health.
- Downloading the data for free is always available
