## What is a Riverscape?
Over time, the idea of what a river should be caught holdâ€”and perhaps you have an image in your mind of a long, winding channel flowing effortlessly through the landscape. 
 
But this image may be part of the problem because rivers are more than a channel that delivers water. A healthy riverscape is an integrated system within a valley bottom, frequently connected to their floodplains, supporting vibrant ecosystems of wildlife habitat, wetlands, and vegetation. 
 
Humans have historically approached riverscapes with a command-and-control mindset, viewing floods as undesirable events to be avoided instead of necessary occurrences. As a result, we became disconnected from many natural infrastructure opportunities. 
 
And so here we are. 

## How We Define A Riverscape 
A riverscape is defined as the part of the landscape (connected network) that could plausibly flood by their rivers & streams in the contemporary natural flow regime. Quite simply, the riverscape is defined laterally by the valley bottom extents, and extends upstream and downstream chasing the channel network that is a part of it.
