> The Riverscapes Consortium is a collective of scientists, riverscape practitioners and supporters tackling urgent riverscape challenges intensified by climate change. Our mission is to create vibrant, healthy riverscapes where thriving ecosystems and human societies can coexist and benefit one another for a more resilient future.

With fifty per cent of rivers in a degraded state in North America alone, our goal is to provide the tools, data, and support people need to restore and sustain riverscape health. 

The Riverscapes Consortium is helping achieve this goal in several ways:
- Advancing the science of riverscapes health and restoration
- Growing the community of riverscape health scientists, policymakers and practitioners
- Developing tools to analyse, report and promote riverscape health
- Hosting and distributing data relevant to riverscape health
- Developing standards that facilitate data interoperability and more rapid decision making

We are committed to building open-source tools to make it easier for researchers, practitioners and students to manage their own riverscapes. 

The breadth of ecological challenges ahead of us requires a diverse community working together across disciplines, geographic boundaries, and perspectives. Our hope is that we can spark scientific collaborations worldwide to more effectively tackle the urgent challenge of riverscape degradation. 


## Our Approach 

Our approach is rooted in the guiding principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse (FAIR) of digital assets. 
How we support and encourage a collaborative riverscapes community: 
- Promote conducting and publishing of science relevant to understanding riverscapes that is findable, accessible, peer-reviewed and rigorous.
- Develop and facilitate sharing of innovative tools that are Findable, Accessible, and ideally Interoperable and Reusable.
- Host and contribute to data warehouses for sharing and discovery of riverscapes data, which are Findable, Accessible, and ideally Interoperable and Reusable.

- Learn more about FAIR data principles (link to FAIR page). 

Through this approach, the Riverscapes Consortium supports a community of practice that pragmatically tackles management and restoration to meet the scope of degradation and threats facing riverscapes around the world.
