# Gatsby special markdown syntaxs

## Baked-in Components

Some components you can use without importing anything. This list will be updated as the theme grows.

### Custom Homepage Components:

These components were designed specifically for the Riverscapes homepage site and may not be that useful for derivative sites.

  * `<HomepageCard />`
  * `<HomepageCardContent />`
  * `<HomepageCardHighlight />`
  * `<HomepageCardStat />`
  * `<Hero />`

### Custom Components for buttons and links:

  * `<Button />` This is `MuiButton` wrapped around the Gatsby Link component for navigation. See examples below.
  * `<Link />` This is Mui's `Link` component wrapped around Gatsby's Link component. See examples below.
  * `<Youtube />` This is a helper since we use a lot of youtube videos. See examples below.

### Material UI Components exposed by default:

There are a few MUI components we expose by default that are relatively safe to use:

  * `<Box />` This is [Mui's `Box` component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-box/). Use it instead of `<div />`
  * `<Stack />` This is [Mui's `Stack` component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-stack/). Use it to space things evenly across the screen.
  * `<Grid />` This is [Mui's `Grid` component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/). This is for more complex layouts and should be used carefully as it may not be mobile-compatible.
  * `<Alert />` This is [Mui's `Alert` component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-alert/). Use it to draw attention or anounce something.
  * *That's all for now. We may add to this list as needed...*

See the Advanced section below for more information on how to use MUI components.

Using homepage elements on non-homepage pages may cause strange things to happen so use it carefully.

As we continue to use and grow our sites we will likely add to this list.

----------------

## Import other MUI Components *(sparingly)*

This site is built on the [Material UI](https://mui.com/) framework. For special cases we may need to use components that are not exposed by default. In order to do that we need to import them from the `@mui/material` package.

#### This should be done sparingly for a number of very good reasons:

1. Our markdown already translates to these components in many cases. Keeping the site as close to pure Markdown as possible keeps the site aligned to the styleguide. When you go rogue with components you can easily deviate from the styleguide.
1. **Maintainability**: The more components we use the more difficult it is to maintain the site. If MUI puts out a new patch that we decide to upgrade to the pure markdown components will not require ANY changes but the custom MUI components will all need to be re-tested across all our sites.
1. **Context**: Not all MUI components are designed to work inside the main content of the page.
2. **Responsiveness**: Not all components are responsive by default. Make sure you preview any changes on a phone or tablet before you commit them.
3. **Modularity**: If you find yourself using the same pattern on multiple pages or multiple sites we should create a new `Baked-in` component for it. This will guarantee consistency across all our sites and make it easier to maintain.

All of that said, if you absolutely need to use MUI components other than the ones that are baked in you must import them:

```typescript
import { Container, Divider, Grid, Card, CardActionArea, CardMedia, CardContent, Typography } from '@mui/material'

<Divider />
```

----------------

## Use MUI Icons

Our theme has access to the [Material UI Icons](https://mui.com/components/material-icons/) library. You can use them in markdown like this:

<FaceIcon />
<Button to='../about-us' color='error' endIcon={<FaceIcon />}>About us Button</Button>

```typescript
import FaceIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Face';
<FaceIcon />
<Button to='../about-us' color='error' endIcon={<FaceIcon />}>About us Button</Button>
```

----------------

## **Don't** Use HTML tags

While HTML tags like are technically allowed in markdown we recommend that you do not use them at all. 

#### Alternatives in descending desirability:

1. Use the markdown equivalent whenever you can. This increases the maintainability of the site and reduces breakages during upgrade.
2. Find a baked-in component that does what you want. (That's why we created them).
3. Create a new baked-in component (or have a developer make one for you). This will mean you can use this new function across ALL sites with this theme.
4. If there is absolutely no other way to do it then it might be best to check with a developer before proceeding.

----------------

## Links

You can easily use remark syntax for links

### Internal Links

### Relative Internal Links

You can either use the markdown syntax or the `<Link />` component

* [About us Link](../about-us) `[About us Link](../about-us)`
* <Link to='../about-us'>About us Link</Link> `<Link to='../about-us'>About us Link</Link>`

**NOTE: Don't use the `<a>` tag. It will not render properly:**
  * <a href='../about-us'>About us Link</a> `<a href='./about-us'>About us Link</a>`

### Absolute Internal Links

You can either use the markdown syntax or the `<Link />` component

* [About us Link](/about-us) `[About us Link](/about-us)`
* <Link to='/about-us'>About us Link</Link> `<Link to='/about-us'>About us Link</Link>`

**NOTE: Once again don't use the `<a>` tag. It will not render or link properly.**

### External Links

External links operate the same way. Linking internally will navigate using the current browser tab and external links will open a new tab.

* [Google](https://google.com) `[Google](https://google.com)`
* <Link to='https://google.com'>Google</Link> `<Link to='https://google.com'>Google</Link>`

**NOTE: Again, don't use the `<a>` tag. It will not render properly.**

----------------

## Buttons

Buttons are almost identical to links. Linking internally will navigate using the current browser tab and external links will open a new tab.

### Internal Links Button


<Button to='../about-us'>About us Button</Button> 
<Button to='../about-us' color='secondary'>About us Button</Button> 
<Button to='../about-us' color='success'>About us Button</Button> 
<Button to='../about-us' color='error'>About us Button</Button> 
<Button to='../about-us' color='error' startIcon={<FaceIcon />}>About us Button</Button> 
<Button to='../about-us' color='error' endIcon={<FaceIcon />}>About us Button</Button> 
```jsx
<Button to='../about-us'>About us Button</Button>
<Button to='../about-us' color='secondary'>About us Button</Button> 
<Button to='../about-us' color='success'>About us Button</Button> 
<Button to='../about-us' color='error'>About us Button</Button> 
```

### External Link Button

<Button to='https://google.com'>Google dot com</Button> 
```jsx
<Button to='https://google.com'>Google dot com</Button>
```

----------------

## Images

Internal images can come from several different places

***Note: Do not use `<StaticImage />` for markdown images. It will not work.***

### 1. Relative to the `.mdx` file

Using a relative path to navigate relative to the mdx file (Note the dot slash `./` which means relative to the current path)

![DemoStatic](./demoRelative.jpg)
```html
![DemoStatic](./demoRelative.jpg)
```

You will notice that `<img>` tags won't work for this method because the path lookup doesn't work. We may fix this at some future point but for now you're stuck with it.
<img src='./demoRelative.jpg' alt="this doesn't work" />

```
<img src='./demoRelative.jpg' alt="this doesn't work" />  <------ NO!
```

### 2. Relative to the site root

Using an absolute path to navigate relative to the site root. (Note the slash `/` which means relative to the site root)

![DemoStatic](/demoRelative.jpg)
```html
![DemoStatic](/demoRelative.jpg)
```

You will notice that, unlike paths relative to the mdx file, the `<img />` tag works here.

<img src='/demoRelative.jpg' alt="this doesn't work" />
```
<img src='/demoRelative.jpg' alt="this doesn't work" />
```

### 3. In the static folder

You can also put images in the `static` folder at the root of your site and reference them from there. **You must use an absolute path for that**.

You can still use the remark syntax

![DemoStatic](/images/demoStatic.jpg)
```
![DemoStatic](/images/demoStatic.jpg)
```

You can also use the `<img />` html element to get maxiumum control over the image.

<img src='/images/demoStatic.jpg' style={{width: '100%'}} />

```
<img src='/images/demoStatic.jpg' style={{width: '100%'}} />
```

### 3. External Images

You can just use Markdown's remark syntax for external images:

![Kitten](https://placekitten.com/200/300)

```markdown
![Kitten](https://placekitten.com/200/300)
```

Or if you need a bit more control you can use the `<img />` HTML syntax

<img src='https://placekitten.com/200/300' style={{border: '20px solid orange'}} />

```markdown
<img src='https://placekitten.com/200/300' style={{border: '20px solid orange'}} />
```

## Youtube embeds

We have a custom component for youtube embedding

<Youtube embedId="1hPxGmTGarM" />

```tsx
<Youtube embedId="1hPxGmTGarM" />
```

You can also embed using the `<iframe />` from youtube but it's not as nice AND you should rename the attributes to be camelCase from `frameborder` to `frameBorder` and `allowfullscreen` to `allowFullScreen` or you get browser console warnings:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hPxGmTGarM?si=fj1mSgn4toCCv5vY" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen></iframe>

----------------

## Code Blocks

In order to get good syntax highlighting you need to use the markdown code block syntax.

```text
NOTE: the single quotes below SHOULD BE backticks. They are not single quotes.
I just can't use backticks in markdown because it will think I'm trying to
put a code block inside a code block.

'''languagename
<CODE HERE>
'''
```

### Javascript example

```javascript

const foo = 'bar'

function baz() {
  return foo
}

```

### Python example

```python

a = 1
b = 2

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

```

# Advanced

## Material UI (MUI)

[MUI Core](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) is a ReactJS implementation of Google's Material Design. It's a very powerful library and we use it extensively. It's also very well documented. You can find a lot of information [on their site](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).


* Do not use the `<Container />` anywhere unless the `isHome: true` frontmatter is set or it will fight with the site's template and responsiveness.

## Stack

`<Stack />` This is [Mui's Stack component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-stack/). Use it to space things evenly either as a row or a column. This is preferable to `<Grid />` for simple layouts.

#### Vertical Stack

<Stack spacing={2} border="2px solid red">
  <Box to=''>Thing 1</Box>
  <Box to=''>Thing 2</Box>
  <Box to=''>Thing 3</Box>
</Stack>

#### Horizontal Stack

<Stack spacing={2} border="2px solid red" direction="row" justifyContent="center">
  <Box to=''>Thing 1</Box>
  <Box to=''>Thing 2</Box>
  <Box to=''>Thing 3</Box>
</Stack>

## Grids

Grids are useful for more complex layouts. They are not responsive by default so you need to use the `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` props to make them responsive. You can also use the `spacing` prop to add space between the grid items. More information can be found [here](https://mui.com/components/grid/).


***NOTE: Always try using `<Stack />` before using `<Grid />`. It's much easier to use and is responsive by default.***

<Grid container border="1px solid red">
  <Grid item xs={12} md={2} border="1px solid blue">Row1-Thing1</Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6} border="1px solid green">Row1-Thing2</Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={4} border="1px solid yellow">Row1-Thing3</Grid>

  <Grid item xs={12} md={4} border="1px solid blue">Row2-Thing1</Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6} border="1px solid green">Row2-Thing2</Grid>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={2} border="1px solid yellow">Row2-Thing3</Grid>
</Grid>

## Alert

Alert is a component that draws attention to something. It's useful for announcements or warnings. You can find more information [here](https://mui.com/components/alert/).

<Alert severity="info">
  This is an info alert — <strong>check it out!</strong>
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
  This is an info alert — <strong>check it out!</strong>
</Alert>

<Alert severity="error">
  This is an info alert — <strong>check it out!</strong>
</Alert>

<Alert severity="success">
  This is an info alert — <strong>check it out!</strong>
</Alert>
